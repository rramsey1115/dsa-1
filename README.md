Data Structures and Algorithms
=======

This project contains a series of small challenges and lessons related to DSA fundamentals. 

All algorithmic problems are solved using JavaScript, due to all students in the cohort having various backgrounds as far as back end languages. 

This course is mostly asynchronous, with two meetings per week. 
One meeting covers weekly concepts, the second meeting is a mock interview with a different DSA challenge related to the weekly materials.
