‚è±Ô∏è Alex's First Playlist Challenge!
Maya pulled out her tablet. "Alex, I think you're ready for a hands-on challenge. Jordan has created a simple playlist system, and I want you to help them solve a common problem."

Jordan nodded enthusiastically. "Here's the scenario: I have a playlist, but I want to find a specific song and then play the song that comes after it. Can you help me write a function to do that?"

üîì Uncomment the below code section in the editor üëâ:

Implement playNextSong() to find a song and play the next one
Use the currentSong.next property to traverse the playlist
Click Run Code
Inspect üìã Console Output window and run test to check for correctness!
"This challenge will help you understand how to navigate through linked structures," Maya explained. "You're not just accessing data - you're following connections."
